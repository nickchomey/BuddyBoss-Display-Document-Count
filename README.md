# BuddyBoss-Display-Document-Count
Snippet to display the document count in BuddyBoss Groups

1. Create new folders in your buddyboss-theme-child folder: wp-content\themes\buddyboss-theme-child\buddypress\groups\single\parts
2. Paste the item-nav.php file inside the /parts folder
3. Paste the contents of functions-php-snippet.php into your child theme's functions.php file or into your Code Snippet plugin of choice.

It should work after that.
